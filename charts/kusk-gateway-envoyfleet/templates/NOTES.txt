Envoy Fleet was installed.

Get the Fleet's Load Balancer External IP address with:

kubectl get svc -l "app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kusk-gateway,app.kubernetes.io/component=envoy-svc,fleet={{ .Release.Name }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}" --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer External IP to be available.

You can use that address to query your deployed endpoints.
